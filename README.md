# White wine classification with kernel methods

The main purpose of this study is to predict wine quality based on physicochemical data.
The data set contains 4898 instances of white wine with 11 features of physicochemical data.
The output variable is the quality (score between 0 and 10).

The problem is turned into a binary classification problem and we apply both classification and regression algorithms with the kernel trick.
We study the influence of the hyper-parameter $\gamma$ of the kernel.
